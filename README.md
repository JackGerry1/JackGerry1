 <summary><h2>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h2></summary>

My coding journey began in 2020 during the COVID pandemic when I started learning Python programming. It was a transformative experience as I discovered my love for coding. During this time, I also enrolled in various courses on FreeCodeCamp to expand my knowledge in web development, Python programming, SQL, and JavaScript.

In 2021, I took a significant step forward in my journey by joining a level 2 ECICT computing course. This comprehensive program covered a wide range of topics, including basic programming, web development, essentials of IT, mobile app development, emerging technology, and cyber security basics. It provided me with a solid foundation and further fueled my passion for coding.

Thanks to my dedication and hard work, I excelled in the ECICT course, achieving a distinction. This accomplishment allowed me to bypass level 3 and directly progress to a level 4/5 foundation degree in software development. In this degree program, I completed the first year, which included in-depth learning in various subjects such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#, web development, computer systems, computer networks, database development, and mathematics for computing.

My journey so far has been filled with continuous growth and learning. I am thrilled to explore new technologies, enhance my programming skills, and apply my knowledge to real-world projects. With each step forward, I am getting closer to achieving my goal of becoming a proficient software developer.

I am excited to continue this journey, embrace new challenges, and contribute to the world of coding through my GitHub profile. Stay tuned for more exciting projects and developments!
